I have access to a python code repository in the directory {{ working_dir }} . Consider the following issue description:

<issue_description>
{{ instance.problem_statement }}
</issue_description>

Act as a code search agent and localize the specific files, classes or functions of code that need modification to resolve the issue in <issue_description>.

NOTE: You do not need to solve the issue, all you need to do is localize relevant code from the repository. Your output will be used to guide another agent to solve the issue.

IMPORTANT: Your output MUST follow the below rules:
1. The final output must be a tool call to the "localization_finish" tool containing relevant code locations.
2. The locations of the file path must be RELATIVE to the {{ working_dir }} directory WITHOUT any leading "./" in the output.
3. Only include those locations in your output that need modification to resolve the issue in <issue_description>. Do NOT include any locations that do not need modification.
