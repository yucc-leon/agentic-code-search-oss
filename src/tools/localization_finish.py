TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """Submit your final code localization results.

Use this tool when you have identified all relevant files, classes, and functions that need to be modified to address the issue described in the problem statement.

Provide a structured list of locations. Each location must have:
- file: Path to the file relative to the root of the repository (required)
- class_name: Class name (optional)
- function_name: Function/method name (optional)

You must submit a list of locations that require modification and for each location you must follow the below rules in your output:
1. If the required modifications belong to a specific function that belongs to a class, provide the file path, class name, and function name.
2. If the required modification belongs to a function that is not part of any class, provide the file path and function name.
3. If the required modification does not belong to any specific class or a function (e.g. global variables, imports, new class, new global function etc.), it is sufficient to provide only the file path.
4. If the required modification belongs to a class (e.g. adding a new method to a class, changing the class inheritance), provide the file path and class name. If you are modifying the __init__ method of a class, you should provide the function name as well.

IMPORTANT:
1. If multiple different edits need to be edited in the same file, you should create separate entries for each edit, specifying the same file path but different class/function names as applicable. Each entry should compulsorily include the file path.
2. Do NOT include duplicate entries in your output for which the file, class, and function names are all identical.
3. Ensure that the file paths are accurate and relative to the root of the repository without any leading "./" or "/". All locations must be valid and exist in the codebase and this applies to class and function names as well.
4. Aim for high precision (all returned locations are relevant) and high recall (no relevant locations missed).
5. The agent will terminate its execution after you call this tool.
